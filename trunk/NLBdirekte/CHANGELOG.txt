Changelog for major- and minor-version releases
(bugfix-releases not mentioned)

0.1: Start of versioning. Rewritten prepare-procedure
		based on XProc, XSLT and Python starting
		on-demand from a PHP-script when the user opens
		the book in NLBdirekte for the first time.
0.2: Works in both Windows and Linux. 
0.3: Attempt at reverting to pure SoundManager2-playback,
		without going through the HTML5AudioNow-script.
0.4: Based on 0.2, has improved browser compatibility,
		most notably IE9 (although Flash in IE9 is still
		buggy at best). Chromium/Chrome, Firefox and
		Opera seems to work best. Safari has issues.
0.5: Quick attempt at improving mobile phone compatibility.
0.6: Check whether the server is currently preparing the
		book, and if so, don't start yet another process
		preparing the book. (only Windows, Linux not
		implemented yet)
0.7: Same as 0.6, but with Linux support.
0.8: DTD resolution against a catalog of cached DTDs is
		implemented and works in Linux. Next up is
		Windows. This DTD resolution is needed since it
		turns out that a lot of XML-files target
		non-existing files. Also, in an operational
		environment DTDs should be cached anyway.
		There is a bug with p:http-request in Calabash
		(currently 0.9.30) as it does not make use
		of the URI resolver given to Calabash.
