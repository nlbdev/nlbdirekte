Changelog for major- and minor-version releases
(bugfix-releases not mentioned)

0.1: Start of versioning. Rewritten prepare-procedure
		based on XProc, XSLT and Python starting
		on-demand from a PHP-script when the user opens
		the book in NLBdirekte for the first time.
0.2: Works in both Windows and Linux. 
0.3: Attempt at reverting to pure SoundManager2-playback,
		without going through the HTML5AudioNow-script.
0.4: Based on 0.2, has improved browser compatibility,
		most notably IE9 (although Flash in IE9 is still
		buggy at best). Chromium/Chrome, Firefox and
		Opera seems to work best. Safari has issues.
0.5: Quick attempt at improving mobile phone compatibility.
0.6: Check whether the server is currently preparing the
		book, and if so, don't start yet another process
		preparing the book. (only Windows, Linux not
		implemented yet)
0.7: Same as 0.6, but with Linux support.
0.8: DTD resolution against a catalog of cached DTDs is
		implemented and works in Linux. Next up is
		Windows. This DTD resolution is needed since it
		turns out that a lot of XML-files target
		non-existing files. Also, in an operational
		environment DTDs should be cached anyway.
		There is a bug with p:http-request in Calabash
		(currently 0.9.30) as it does not make use
		of the URI resolver given to Calabash.
0.9: DTD resolution for Windows. Updated installation
		instrunctions.
0.10: Accesskeys for the menu buttons (map to numbers 1-6),
		Prettier TOC, Prettier pagelist (fixed pagelist
		not being created in python script as well)
0.11: config.inc.php and config.js are now used to configure
		each specific installation of NLBdirekte.
0.12: Replaced the HTML5Now-module with pure SoundManager2.
		Audio playback now works across more browsers but
		stuttering and other problems have been introduced.
		Further debugging and improvements are still needed
		on the audio playback front.
0.13: Tried with configurable DamnIT-integration. Then
		removed it and introduced log4javascript as an
		optional dependency for logging. log4javascript
		replaces all the 'console.log'-calls that caused
		problems earlier. log4javascript is configurable
		through config.js and logs to both Firebug-style
		browser-logs as well as server-side log files
		through JSON XMLHttpRequests.
0.14: Moved from jQuery UI to jQuery Mobile. Moved controls
		from top to bottom. Bigger buttons. Fixed positioning
		should now work on mobile devices, however jQuery Mobile
		is still in alpha so it may have bugs.
